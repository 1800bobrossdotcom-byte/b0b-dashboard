## 1. What is Clawdbot?

Clawdbot (now rebranded as **Moltbot**) is a self-hosted AI assistant framework that operates on your hardware - whether that's your Mac, Linux machine, or a small VPS costing as little as $5/month.

Unlike cloud-based chatbots, Clawdbot runs locally on your infrastructure, giving you **full control over security, data, and computational resources**.

### Core Value for Traders

Clawdbot bridges AI capabilities with the tools you already use. It connects to:
- Telegram
- Discord  
- WhatsApp
- X (Twitter)

**Simultaneously.** For Polymarket traders, this means your AI agent can monitor prices, execute trades, analyze social sentiment, and alert you - all through familiar messaging interfaces.

## 2. How Clawdbot Connects to Trading Infrastructure

Clawbot functions as a **central nervous system** for your trading operation:

### 1. X Integration
Monitor real-time tweets about your trading markets, track sentiment shifts, and identify breaking news before prices adjust. Clawdbot can pull X data through its web browsing capabilities and analyze it for trading signals.

### 2. Polymarket Account Link
Through Polymarket's **CLOB (Central Limit Order Book) API**, Clawdbot connects directly to your trading account, enabling:
- Order placement
- Portfolio monitoring
- Real-time price tracking

### 3. Telegram Integration
Receive notifications and send commands to Clawdbot via Telegram DMs or group chats. This is your mobile command center.

### 4. Discord Integration
Set up a dedicated Discord server where Clawdbot channels important alerts, trade executions, and performance data.

### 5. Persistent Memory System
Unlike standard chatbots, Clawbot maintains **continuous memory** across sessions, remembering your:
- Trading history
- Positions
- Risk parameters
- Past decisions

## 3. Real Use Cases for Polymarket Trading

### 1) Real-Time Market Research

Clawbot becomes your personal quant research department, running 24 strategies simultaneously across all active markets.

**Multi-Market Arbitrage Scanner:**
```
Scans 10+ correlated markets every 15 seconds:

• "Trump wins election" → "Harris wins election"
• "BTC >$100K Dec" → "ETH >$5K Dec" 
• "Fed cuts rates" → "S&P500 monthly gain"
```

**Opportunity Detection:**
When combined YES/NO < $1.00 → Instant arb

Example: 
- Market A YES @ 0.48 + Market B NO @ 0.49 
- = Guaranteed $1.00 payout for $0.97 cost

### 2) Social Sentiment Divergence

Every 60 seconds per market:
```
1. Scrapes 100 latest X tweets by keywords
2. Claude NLP → Bullish/Neutral/Bearish scores
3. Compares vs current odds
4. Alerts when divergence >20%
```

**Example Signal:**
> "Tesla robotaxi event" market: 62¢ YES
> X sentiment: 82% bullish (vs 62% implied)
> BUY signal @ +20% edge

### 3) Liquidity Momentum Tracker

Monitors bid/ask spreads + order book depth:
```
• Thin liquidity + breaking news = volatility trap
• Deep liquidity + whale orders = trend continuation
• Fakeouts detected by rapid spread widening
```

**Setup:** Poll Polymarket CLOB API every 5 seconds → flag liquidity shifts >30%

### 4) Trade Analysis & Mistake Tracking

Automatic post-mortem logging:
```
Every trade records:
• Entry thesis + probability estimate
• Market conditions at entry  
• Position size vs Kelly optimal
• Outcome vs expected value
```

**Monthly mistake report identifies:**
- Calibration errors (over/under confident)
- Process breaks (deviated from rules)
- Information gaps (missed key data)
- Execution failures (bad timing)

### 5) Polymarket Insider Analyzer

Tracks "smart money" wallets via analytics APIs (Polymarket Analytics, Polysights).

**Identifies insiders by:**
- New wallets → massive single-market bets
- Perfect timing on rare events
- High hit rates on low-odds outcomes

**Real-time signals:**
```
"Wallet 0xABC just bought $250K YES @ 0.12
Market now 0.28 (+133%)
Follow or fade?"
```

### 6) Performance Metrics Dashboard

Clawdbot builds your personal trading dashboard tracking all key metrics.

4. **Multi-market arb** → Cross-reference correlated tokens
5. **Mistake logging** → Already logging trades, add post-mortem analysis
