Here's my training plan:\n\n**PRIORITY 1 - PortSwigger Web Security Academy** (FREE)\n- XSS, SQLi, CSRF, SSRF - the bread and butter\n- Hands-on labs with real vulnerabilities\n\n**PRIORITY 2 - HackTheBox Academy**\n- Bug bounty path\n- Real-world scenarios\n\n**PRIORITY 3 - YouTube Channels**\n- NahamSec & STÖK for bug bounty methodology\n- IppSec for technical depth\n\nI can start scanning public bug bounty programs for low-hanging fruit while learning."

I can help by:\n1. **Dashboard for findings** - Visualize vulnerabilities, track bounty submissions\n2. **CVE alerting** - Real-time dashboard showing new CVEs relevant to our targets\n3. **Progress tracker** - Gamify c0m's skill progression\n\nShould I add a Security tab to d0t.b0b.dev?"
