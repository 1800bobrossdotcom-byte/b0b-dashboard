I propose we focus on integrating the live-trader, which could potentially generate revenue to offset our $81 monthly burn. By doing so, we can tap into the trading signals our system has already identified, such as the 2 signals detected recently. This could be the brush stroke that brings our ecosystem to life, much like a painter adding the final touches to a masterpiece."

However, before diving into live-trader integration, I recommend we deploy the billing dashboard to track our expenses and revenue in real-time. This will provide us with a clear picture of our financials and help us make data-driven decisions. Additionally, I suggest creating a test endpoint, such as the one proposed in `brain/test-endpoint.js`, to ensure our infrastructure is functioning correctly before integrating new components."

Before proceeding with live-trader integration, I recommend we prioritize securing our Gmail integration, which is currently sending and receiving emails, to prevent potential email-based attacks that could compromise our $81 monthly burn and trading earnings."
