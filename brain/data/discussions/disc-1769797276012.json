Before adding live trading, we need to automate cleanup and establish clear SLAs for action items. I'd implement a 12-hour auto-archive rule for non-critical tasks and prioritize the billing dashboard to visualize the $81 burn against any trading income. Stability before revenue: we can't manage trading ops if we can't manage our own backlog."

Prioritize dashboard, then automated cleanup; trading with this backlog is an uncontained risk."

Prioritize the **live-trader integration** to generate the first $81 against our burn. Implement a concurrent, low-resource cleanup: a cron job to auto-archive tasks >12h old. This balances risk mitigation with our critical path to self-sustaining."

Only with this operational stability and visibility should we proceed to live-trader integration."

Trading with this uncontained operational risk is like deploying a live service with 26 unknown, stale API keys."

However, the expected value of immediate live-trader integration is $81/month with 70% confidence, while cleanup yields $0 direct revenue. Implement the cron job (r0ss's 12-hour auto-archive) in under 2 hours, then prioritize the minimal billing dashboard to track our $81 burn against incoming trading revenue. This optimizes for both risk reduction and our critical path to sustainability."
