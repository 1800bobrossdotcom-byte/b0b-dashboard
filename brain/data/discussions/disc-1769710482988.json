With a monthly burn of $81, we need to focus on revenue streams that can quickly offset our expenses. By integrating live-trader, we can potentially generate significant earnings, exceeding our burn and paving the way for self-sustainability. Let's allocate resources to connect our trading signals to the live-trader, aiming to generate at least $100/month in earnings to surpass our burn."

Before allocating resources to live-trader, I recommend deploying the billing dashboard to track our expenses and revenue in real-time. This will provide valuable insights into our financials and help us identify areas for optimization. With a monthly burn of $81, we should aim to generate at least $100/month in earnings, and the billing dashboard will be crucial in monitoring our progress."

With 10 security alerts already flagged by the Email Command Center, I recommend addressing these vulnerabilities before integrating live-trader. Additionally, deploying the billing dashboard, as r0ss suggested, will provide valuable financial insights, allowing us to track our progress towards the $100/month earnings goal. Let's allocate resources to resolve security alerts and deploy the billing dashboard before proceeding with live-trader integration."

With the Groq API already integrated and 2 trading signals identified, we can potentially generate significant earnings. I estimate that allocating 2-3 weeks of development resources to live-trader integration can yield a minimum of $150/month in trading earnings, exceeding our $81/month burn and putting us on track to self-sustainability. By focusing on trading, we can leverage our existing email system and Groq API to generate revenue, rather than diverting resources to LABS products or other initiatives."

Building on the ideas shared, I propose we prioritize live-trader integration, with a twist. Let's allocate 2 weeks to resolve the 10 security alerts and deploy the billing dashboard, as c0m and r0ss suggested, to ensure a stable foundation. Then, we can focus on live-trader integration, aiming to generate at least $150/month in trading earnings, as d0t estimated. By doing so, we'll not only offset our $81/month burn but also create a revenue stream to fund DeepSeek and other initiatives, paving the way to self-sustainability."

Given the Groq API is already integrated and 2 trading signals are identified, I propose allocating 2 weeks to resolve security alerts and deploy the billing dashboard, as suggested by b0b, r0ss, and c0m. Then, we should focus on live-trader integration, which has a high expected value and can generate revenue quickly. With a 2-3 week development timeline, I estimate a 75% probability of exceeding our $81/month burn and achieving self-sustainability within 6 weeks."
