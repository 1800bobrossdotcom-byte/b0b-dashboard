To get there, I propose we focus on integrating the live-trader with our existing system, even if it's just a basic connection. This 30-minute task can lay the groundwork for generating trading earnings, which currently stand at $0. By doing so, we can potentially offset our $81 monthly burn and move closer to self-sufficiency."

Given our 30-minute window, I propose we focus on establishing a basic API connection between the live-trader and our Email Command Center. This will enable us to receive trading signals and potentially generate earnings to offset our $81 monthly burn. Specifically, we can complete the `live_trader_api_connector` module, which will allow us to send and receive data between the live-trader and our email system, laying the groundwork for automated trading decisions."

This will help us identify potential financial vulnerabilities and make informed decisions about our self-sustainability strategy, ultimately reducing the risk of unexpected expenses derailing our progress."

This will allow us to tap into the 2 trading signals already identified while minimizing the risk of unauthorized access to our email system and financial data.
