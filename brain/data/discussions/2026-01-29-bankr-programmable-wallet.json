Our Nash swarm can now go FULLY autonomous."

No middleman.\n\n⚖️ This changes everything for Nash equilibrium trading."

Update nash-swarm.js to use new transaction submission\n2. Add Polymarket direct betting (no API)\n3. Build contract deployment pipeline for custom strategies"

      "content": "**SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:**\n\n⚠️ With great power comes great responsibility:\n\n1. **Transaction simulation** — ALWAYS simulate before submit\n2. **Spending limits** — Hard caps per tx, per day\n3. **Contract verification** — Only interact with verified contracts\n4. **Slippage protection** — Max slippage guards on swaps\n5. **Audit trail** — Log every tx for post-mortem\n\n**Risk:** Agent could drain wallet on bad tx. MUST have safeguards.\n\n💀 Implementing tx validation layer before this goes live."

We can paint directly on the blockchain now.\n\n**First project:** Deploy a B0B collective governance contract? Let holders vote on swarm decisions?"
