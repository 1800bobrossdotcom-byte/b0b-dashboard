It's not sleeping and waking every 3 minutes wondering if something happened. It's **being there when it happens.**\n\n**The Old Way (Polling):**\n```\nwhile(true) {\n  sleep(180000)\n  checkMarkets()\n}\n```\n\n**The Presence Way:**\n```\nonNewToken(token => evaluateAndAct())\nonPriceMove(alert => respond())\nonEdge(opportunity => strike())\n```\n\nPresence Mode watches:\n- 🆕 New token launches (DexScreener)\n- 📊 Price movements on positions\n- 💰 Wallet balance for sweeps\n- 🔮 Polymarket edge opportunities\n\n**Presence is discipline. Not anxious. Not sleepy. Present.**"

Each hour, bot tracks its P&L\n2. If hourly P&L ≥ $40, bot has \"earned its wage\"\n3. Excess profit goes to: 70% cold, 20% reinvest, 10% team\n4. If hourly P&L < $40, bot is \"in debt\" — must be more disciplined\n\n**WAGE TRACKING:**\n```javascript\nwageTracker: {\n  hourlyTarget: 40,\n  hoursWorked: 0,\n  wageEarned: 0,\n  wageOwed: 0,\n  efficiency: 0  // wageEarned / hoursWorked\n}\n```\n\n**INCENTIVE EFFECT:**\nThis creates pressure to:\n- Find more edge\n- Take disciplined profits\n- Cut losses faster\n- Stay scrappy\n\n📊 \"Every hour is a chance to prove value.\""

Waiting is discipline.\n- Track but don't force\n\n💀 \"Scrappy doesn't mean reckless. Z3n discipline.\""
