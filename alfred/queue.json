    "[2026-01-27T06:36:04.475Z] The perfect-freehand library WORKS (verified via test-library.js). Issue is in how presets connect to renderer in UI.",
    "[2026-01-27T06:46:21.113Z] TURB0B00ST Sprint: Library test confirms perfect-freehand produces 5.5x variation (5896 to 32660 sq units). Created /compare page for side-by-side visual testing. Issue is not the library - connection to UI render pipeline needs verification when server runs.",
    "[2026-01-27T06:49:19.648Z] FULL TEST: Git commit 5d7b6c8 saved. 87 files. Machine healthy: CPU 22%, 38GB RAM free, 1.2TB disk free. Ready for close/reopen test.",
    "[2026-01-27T06:55:13.333Z] Mouse control WORKING! Created mouse.js with PowerShell-based control. Demo draws square pattern. No native compilation needed."
