## Core Principles

### Studio Philosophy (ertdfgcvb)
- Procedural graphics and animations for screen and print
- Research and development
- Hardware prototyping
- Interactive installations
- Realtime visualisations

### Aesthetic Characteristics

1. **RESTRAINT** — Not everything needs to move or flash
2. **MONOCHROME** — Single color palettes, not rainbow tech-bro
3. **FLAT** — No gradients, no glow, no noise overlay
4. **TYPOGRAPHY-FIRST** — Let text breathe, minimal decoration
5. **PROCEDURAL** — Code-driven but subtle
6. **KINETIC BUT CALM** — Movement with purpose, not chaos

### Color Philosophy
- Often single color on white/black
- When color: mindful, intentional
- No "tech startup" blue/purple/green combos
- Think: ink on paper, terminal on CRT

### ASCII Art Style
- Clean character sets
- Rhythm and repetition
- Perfect loops
- Hypnotic but not aggressive

## Key Works Referenced
- Tower 10 — perfect loops, entrancing
- Terminals — textmode aesthetics
- Textmode — ASCII/ANSI traditions
- 64 Pixels — constraint as beauty

## Application to B0B/L0RE

### What to AVOID
- ❌ Flashy gradients
- ❌ Multiple competing colors
- ❌ Busy backgrounds
- ❌ "Tech dashboard" aesthetic
- ❌ Noise overlays for "effect"
- ❌ Blue/purple as default

### What to EMBRACE
- ✓ Single color palette per view
- ✓ White space as design element
- ✓ Typography as art
- ✓ Subtle animation, purposeful
- ✓ Monochrome options
- ✓ Flat, clean surfaces
- ✓ Let content breathe

## Palette Ideas for L0RE

### Warm Monochrome
- Cream/off-white background
- Warm black text (#1a1a1a)
- Single accent (terracotta, ochre)

### Cool Monochrome  
- Near-white (#fafafa)
- Blue-black (#0a0a14)
- Single accent (slate, steel)

### Terminal Classic
- True black (#000)
- Green/amber phosphor
- Nothing else

### Paper
- Warm white (#fffef8)
- Ink black (#111)
- Red accent (proofing marks)
