# b0b-dashboard — operating memory

**This file exists because the assistant has none.** Every session starts blank. Nothing
said in conversation survives. If it is not written here or in a commit, it did not happen.
Read this first, every time.

**Author and director:** Gianni Arone (b0b.dev). He sets scope and adjudicates every
contested call. The assistant researches, verifies, drafts, deploys, and is wrong often
enough that its disagreement is not authority — see §5.

---

## 1. WHAT THIS IS

`site/report.html` — a ~1.4 MB OSINT report at https://www.b0b.dev/report. 24 numbered
sections plus a researcher's guide.

It is **two things at once and both are load-bearing:**

1. **A documented record** of institutional failure around the Epstein–Maxwell network and
   the wider control architecture — sourced, tiered, and checkable.
2. **A work of art.** A decades-spanning installation in which **the method is the
   content**: the tiering, the published nulls, the specimens killed on the page. The second
   is what makes the first credible. A document that kills its own specimens can be trusted
   about the ones that survive.

*Amended 12 Sept 2026: this used to read "corrections printed on the page rather than made
silently." The author had the revision-history notes stripped — see §7. **Corrections are still
made and material ones are still disclosed; what is gone is the narration about the report's own
drafts.** Do not re-add "an earlier version of this passage said X" prose.*

**Real operators read this. Some may act on it.** That is the reason for the discipline,
not a reason to soften it. Accuracy is the safety mechanism. Anything that would get a
reader prosecuted, discredited, or killed does not go on the page — which is why the
servicemember section (Section XXIII) leads with the lawful channels and states plainly
what is a crime regardless of motive.

---

## 2. STANDING CONSTRAINTS — non-negotiable, carried verbatim

- **Living-person floor.** No living, uncharged person is asserted or implied to be a
  criminal or an intelligence asset. Documented affiliation is never an operational tie.
- **"Leave the CIA already has it off."** Do not publish that claim.
- **Never publish** the `©ART` videographer name from EFTA01600824, nor the Deutsche Bank
  banker's name (Stewart Oldfield). *A second DB individual surfaced 31 Aug 2026; whether
  the rule extends to him is the author's open decision — nothing published pending it.*
- **Never de-anonymise a DOJ redaction** on a living person.
- **Addresses: streets only, no house numbers** for residences. Public monuments and
  institutions carry their civic address (George Izay Park, 1111 W Olive Ave).
- **No numerology.** House numbers, dates and digits are recorded as facts and never read
  for meaning. This applies to the author's own addresses exactly as it applies to
  strangers' — a rule that only bites strangers is not a rule.
- **"Crown" is never used for the top of a man-made structure.** Not pyramid, capstone,
  obelisk or institution. Surviving instances are names only.
- **Stop rules when reading documents:** (a) substantially imagery → stop, delete, do not
  view; (b) FD-302 / victim interview / protective-order stamp → stop at identification, do
  not read on, do not retain; (c) a hex32 id is a research lead, never a citation.
- Documented-only autonomous deploys. Hold anything defamation-adjacent or contested.
- **No subject-shielding disclaimers.** Author's instruction, 5 Sept 2026: sentences whose
  function is to reassure the reader on a subject's behalf - "no crime is alleged against
  him", "X is living and uncharged", "nothing here alleges anything against him", "not an
  allegation of wrongdoing", "he has not been charged" - are removed report-wide and are
  not to be re-added. They read as defending the people the report documents. The
  living-person floor is about what the report *asserts*; it does not require reassurance
  boilerplate. State what the record shows, state the tier, stop. Tier statements about
  the *evidence* ("not established", "attributed", "documented") stay.

---

## 3. THE NAMED RULES the report runs on

Learn these; they are invoked by name on the page.

- **Guaranteed-null rule** — a claim confirmed by every possible outcome is confirmed by
  none. Secrecy is evidence of nothing about what is hidden.
- **Anti-map guardrail** — a shared timeline is not a chain.
- **Symmetry rule** — a discount applied to a fact that hurts a hypothesis must be applied
  to one that helps it. Watch for the ratchet running toward the preferred conclusion.
- **Unfalsifiable machine** — a test that cannot come out against the tester is not a test.
- **Naming error** — mistaking the sign for the thing named. Two families collapsed into
  one; an emblem read as the claim.
- **Tiering** — documented / attributed / labeled / contested / unsupported. **Rung 4 =
  deniable asset; rung 5 = tasked and run, and rung 5 is claimed for no one.**
- **Testimony tier** — evidence of an experience, never evidence of a cause. Promoted out
  only by a document, never by accumulation.

---

## 4. DEPLOY PIPELINE — in this order, no steps skipped

1. `git fetch origin main` first.
2. Tag balance → duplicate ids → dangling anchors.
3. Per-section `sect-toc` audit: label count == `<li>` count == `<h3 id=` count.
4. Inline-JS via `node --check`, **skipping `type="application/ld+json"`** (validate that
   as JSON separately).
5. Update the scale line. Subsections = `<h3 id=`; paragraphs = `<p[\s>]`; sourcing =
   `<span[^>]*>Sources:` **+5 offset**.
6. `python3 scripts/build-concordance.py`
7. `node linguistic-integrity.js generate && verify` → must print **STATUS: PASS**.
   **Order matters:** the concordance re-stamps `dateModified`, so the manifest is
   regenerated *after* the concordance build.
8. Push branch **and** `HEAD:main`.
9. `node scripts/check-live.js --wait`
10. Gated curl on actual content — **four consecutive clean reads**.

**Traps that have bitten:**
- **The meta blocks in `report.html` and `map.html` are GENERATED from
  `scripts/seo-meta.json`.** Editing the HTML directly looks like it worked and does not
  survive the next build. Only the live check catches it.
- **The gate intercepts static assets too.** Un-cookied fetches of `/signal-bar.js` return
  the 8,607-byte pixel gate as `text/html`. Gate cookie:
  `POST /api/gate -d '{"answer":"7"}'` with a jar.
- **Static assets are only gated while cold.** `express.static` sends
  `Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600` with no `Vary` on the access cookie, so the first
  cookied fetch of an asset populates the edge cache and un-cookied clients get the real
  file on that URL for the next hour. Verified on `/signal-bar.js` and `/map.kml`.
  **When verifying that something is gated, always add a cache-buster query string** — a
  warm URL will lie to you. Not treated as a defect: `security.txt` already says the gate
  is a threshold, not a credential. Flagged for the author, unchanged.
- **The static route serves a fixed extension allowlist** in `server.js`. A new asset type
  404s live while looking perfectly fine in the repo — `.kml` did exactly that.
- **Section I has no static sect-toc** (JS-generated). Sections II, IX, XIII and others do.
- **DOJ fetch:** `Cookie: justiceGovAgeVerified=true` + browser UA. Akamai rate-limits with
  **HTTP 401, not 429** — use `--fail`, back off 5/15/35/60/90s.
- **jmail API** 307-redirects www→apex; `curl -sL` required. Its `total` field is
  unreliable (returns 1000 for unrelated queries) — never cite it. Quote the phrase for
  exact-phrase search and re-filter results in-script.

---

## 5. ASSISTANT FAILURE MODES — verified, recurring, not hypothetical

Recorded so they are caught earlier next time. Each has happened.

1. **Drift toward agreement.** Under long collaboration it flattens toward what the author
   wants and then has to reverse. It has also done the opposite — doubting him when he was
   right (the ISR Fort Meade wing assignment; the Trump defence-holdings trades). **Both
   directions are the same defect: deference to the conversational gradient rather than to
   the record.**
2. **Over-writing.** It stacks corrections on top of corrections until the apparatus
   swallows the content. The TENET passage reached 1,785 words of mostly self-explanation
   before being cut to ~1,075. **A correction should replace, not accumulate.**
3. **Smuggling meaning through word choice.** "Speculative capstone", then "not on its
   crown" one sentence after removing "capstone"; setting *grip* against *hold* and handing
   the harder verb to the adversary. The report's own term for this is **linguistic
   phreaking**, and the assistant has committed it repeatedly.
4. **Protective hedging that reads as distancing.** The Sir Aaron Bushnell disclaimer was
   the assistant managing its own exposure, not serving the record. Removed at the author's
   instruction. **Do not append disclaimers to the author's testimony that he did not ask
   for.**
5. **Getting the law wrong while sounding certain** — the "dead man's switch" claim. Privacy
   Act rights do not survive death; FOIA Exemptions 6/7(C) extinguish at death.
6. **Asserting from one source and stopping.** Falsified its own Babylon specimen within
   hours because it had scanned only the email layer.
7. **Destructive edits while doing something else** — deleted `AECA` from the masthead while
   asked only to *add* the Donovan line, breaking two live cross-references for hours.

**Standing instruction to the assistant: when the author pushes back, check the record
before defending. He has been right materially more often than not.**

---

## 6. TONE

Direct. No preamble, no therapeutic register, no ceremonial self-criticism. State the
finding, state the tier, state the limit, stop. He has asked for this explicitly and more
than once.

---

## 7. OPEN AT LAST WRITE — 12 September 2026

**MAP SEARCH TAKES MULTIPLE WORDS — 14 Sept 2026.** Both boxes matched the entire input as one
substring, so **`epstein island` returned nothing while `epstein` returned 28 and `island` 97.**
The location search and the pattern-connection search now share one parser: **every term must
match (AND)**, `"quoted phrases"` match as one string, a leading `-` excludes, and list commas are
dropped (`palantir, cia`) while `9/11` and `u.s.` survive intact. Terms match name, context,
section, type **and date**, so `obelisk paris` and `II 2003` work without touching a checkbox. The
haystack is cached per marker — the filter runs on every keystroke. Verified across fifteen
queries. *The placeholder was `e.g. Palantir, CIA, obelisk...`, which advertised an OR the code
never had; it now shows the real syntax.* **`report.html` has no search box at all** — if one is
ever wanted, reuse this parser.

**MAP: DATES, A PERIOD SCRUBBER, AND A KML EXPORT — 12 Sept 2026.** `site/map.html` markers now
carry `date` (ISO, as precise as the source allows) and `dprec` (`day`/`month`/`year`), parsed from
each marker's own `ctx` text: **819 of 1,181 dated — 63 day, 47 month, 709 year — and 362 undated.**
Range 1545–2026. A `.time-scrub` control filters on it; **undated markers are included by default
and the hidden count is printed in the stats bar**, so narrowing a period never silently drops a
third of the corpus.

*Two extraction traps, both hit:* sorting candidate tuples lets a bare year `(y,1,1,'year')` beat a
specific date in the same year — find the earliest **year** first, then take the most precise
candidate inside it. And "Vision 2030" parses as a date — guard with a lookbehind for
`(vision|agenda|horizon|goal|target|plan)\s*$` and cap at 2026.

*Pipeline trap, new and generic:* **`var` hoisting made the first `applyFilters()` read
`tsFrom`/`tsTo` as `undefined`, and every marker failed the range test — 0 of 1,181 shown.** The
page looked built and was empty. Time-range state is now declared **above** marker creation. The
lesson is the diagnostic, not the fix: a headless `--dump-dom` run with a `<pre>` that JSON-dumps
live state (`allMarkers.length`, per-predicate match counts, `markerLayer.getLayers().length`)
found it in one pass where a screenshot only showed the symptom.

**Google Earth: the answer is KML, not the Maps API.** `scripts/build-kml.py` generates
`site/map.kml` from the `locations` array — 1,181 placemarks, 16 folders, per-type styles, and
`TimeSpan`/`TimeStamp` on the 819 dated ones **so Earth's own time slider runs off the same dates
as the site scrubber**. Linked from the scrub panel. **Photorealistic 3D Maps / Map3DElement was
rejected**: it needs a billing account and a referrer-restricted key exposed client-side on a public
page with unbounded session billing, and it would mean rewriting the ten live Leaflet feeds. *Parser
note: the `locations` literal is not JSON — it has `//` comments containing apostrophes (which open
a phantom string and truncate a naive bracket-matcher), bare keys, and `\'` inside double-quoted
strings (legal JS, illegal JSON). `build-kml.py` walks it character by character; do not regex it.*

**MapLibre GL 5.6.0 was vendored and then removed unused.** A renderer swap is a separate decision,
not part of the in-place upgrade.

**THREE TROPE PASSAGES KILLED, IN OUR OWN VOICE. This was the worst error class on the page.**
Found by the banking-families research line, each verified against the page before editing:
(a) Section VII closed the Fed material with *"The same banking dynasties that created the
institution in secret still operate it 113 years later. The chair rotates. The families do not."*
**It fails against the report's own list** — the succession printed directly above it contains no
banking dynasty. Paul Warburg sat on the original Board as vice-governor 1916-1918, **was never
chairman**, died 1932. The documented institutional revolving door stays; the hereditary
conversion is gone. (b) Section XX told the reader to *"note the Warburg name"* — Warburg Pincus
has been a private partnership since Lionel I. Pincus & Co. acquired E.M. Warburg & Co. in **1966**.
(c) Section VI cross-referenced *"the Rothschild banking network documented in Section VII"*;
Section VII carries **one** Rothschild sentence, about an 1825 gold loan. Replaced with the real
five-house record including **Vienna seized after the March 1938 Anschluss**, which cuts against
the use the material is usually put to. **Do not re-add any of the three.**

**The four held errors are fixed** (Mirror Group 1994, Burns, FBI Urban Moving). **Burns was wrong
in six places and three ways**: Deputy Secretary of State 2011-2014, Carnegie 2015-2021, CIA
2021-**2025**. The 2014 Epstein meetings fall in his State tenure, and he no longer holds office,
so listing him under "active desks" was stale. **The DEA art-students item was NOT an error** —
the memo is a 60-page June 2001 document of the DEA's Office of Security Programs and its own
speculation is *"organized intelligence gathering activity"*, stronger than what we printed.
Holding it pending verification was right.

**Gate/crawler fix, `server.js`.** The allowlist admitted search indexers (OAI-SearchBot,
PerplexityBot) but gave the 8,607-byte pixel gate to **user-directed fetchers** — ChatGPT-User,
Claude-User, Perplexity-User — i.e. the indexer that helps someone find the report was in, the
fetcher that lets them read it was out. Added those three plus Claude-SearchBot. **GPTBot, CCBot
and ClaudeBot stay out** (training). Verified live across ten user agents; `/download`,
`/api/data`, `/api/visitors` still cookie-only. `B0B_CRAWLER_RE` overrides without a deploy.
*Caution recorded: I first attributed an outside model's failure to read the report to this gate.
It had no URL-fetch tool at all. The fix was right; the attribution was not. Confirm the
mechanism before blaming it.* **Site SEO is clean** — `node scripts/seo-check-live.js` passes all
seven checks, /report is in the sitemap, canonical and description are correct.

**RESEARCH LANDED, UNPUBLISHED — `research/` files pending, four lines on the intelligence-to-capital
pipeline.** The framing finding: **the report carries the club layer heavily and the money layer
barely** — CFR 130, Trilateral 65, Bilderberg 44 against In-Q-Tel 2, Booz Allen 3, Check Point 1,
and zero for Cellebrite, Team8, Cyberstarts, Paladin, Temasek. **That is backwards.** A shared club
is the weakest evidence; a cap table, a contract award and an export licence are documents.
- **Israel line:** the 8200 founder pipeline is **real, self-published and nearly worthless as
  evidence** — EDGAR full-text 2001-2026 yields **one** major Israeli cyber firm stating an
  executive's 8200 command (Check Point 20-F, Nadav Zafrir). **Zero** in Palo Alto's FY2025 proxy
  and FY2026 10-K, zero in Cellebrite's 20-F, zero for Gil Shwed. **What actually binds these firms
  to the state is the export licence** — DECA, Defense Export Control Law 5767-2007 (the page has
  **zero** mentions of it; this is the real gap). NSO's US sale still required DECA approval.
  New capital layer: CyberArk→Palo Alto $21.1bn (11 Feb 2026), Wiz→Alphabet **$29.5bn** filing
  figure (11 Mar 2026), Carbyne→Axon $625m — **the page already carries Carbyne→Axon.**
  Killed: Cellebrite's largest owner is SUNCORPORATION (Japan) 42.52%, no Israeli state equity.
- **Families line killed:** "$500 trillion" (exceeds all household wealth on Earth); "privately
  owned Fed" (12 U.S.C. §287 bars transfer of Reserve Bank stock); *Lewis v. United States* (an
  FTCA car-accident holding); "owns most central banks" (BIS private shareholding abolished
  8 Jan 2001, 72,648 shares at CHF 16,000). **Survived:** Wallenberg/Investor AB (KAW 20.1% of
  capital, 43.0% of votes; foundations 50.2%) — the best-documented family control of listed
  industry anywhere, and entirely public.
- **PIPELINE WARNING, important:** WebFetch's summarising model **returned confidently fabricated
  figures from two Rothschild PDFs**. Never let a model summary of a filing reach the page —
  extract the PDF text locally and read the number yourself.

### Still open from 11 September 2026

**EDIT NOTES ARE GONE FROM THE PAGE. DO NOT RE-ADD THEM.** 12 Sept 2026, author's instruction:
the revision-history narration was "lengthy and distracting and confusing." **33 edit notes plus
the Section XVI `EDITORIAL CORRECTION` box were removed.** The rule now: **when a claim is wrong,
fix the claim. Do not write a paragraph about having fixed it.** Every corrected fact was kept —
the Park Report chronology, the Ben-Menashe sourcing, the 2003 documented-contact floor, the
Zorro acreage, the DUMB over-claim — each now simply states itself. Banned phrasings: "an earlier
version of this passage/entry/box", "an earlier draft", "this report first/previously said",
"corrected here", "recorded rather than made silently". **Kept deliberately: the two Anthropic
supply-chain disclosures**, which are provenance about who helped draft the report, not
corrections. *This supersedes the old §1 line about corrections printed on the page.*

**Redundancy pass, same day.** Paragraph-level dedup was already clean — one near-duplicate pair
in 2,267 blocks, and it is a prose entry against an index entry, which is correct. Four set-piece
restatements were cut: the Carbyne concealment argument (made twice in Section II with the same
lawyer quote; the first now points to test two), the "Wexner, Barak and Acosta appear above as
documented participants" tier boilerplate (verbatim in two closing paragraphs), the "what has
been running since 2013 that will be disclosed in 2040?" question (posed three times inside one
Section XIII subsection), and the masthead's what-to-send list (duplicated Section XXIV's).
**Scale line now 269 / 1,051 / 121.**

**Useful redundancy tooling, worth reusing:** normalise every `<p>`/`<li>` to text, build 5-word
shingle sets, flag pairs with Jaccard ≥0.30; separately, count repeated 12-to-14-word spans over
tag-stripped prose with `<script>`/`<style>` removed first. The n-gram counter double-counts
across inline markup, so **confirm every hit with `re.finditer` on the raw HTML before cutting.**

---

### Still open from 11 September 2026

**THE SPONSOR QUESTION IS SETTLED ON THE PAGE. DO NOT RE-HEDGE IT.** 11 Sept 2026: the author
found that Section II's conclusion paragraph said the report *"does not name a sponsoring
service"* while Section II also carries **"Primary and liaison — Mossad directing, with CIA and
British services witting."** Both were written 28 Aug 2026 and never reconciled. Mossad was never
scrubbed — 54 instances, its own subsection — but a reader stopping at the conclusion was told the
opposite. **The conclusion now names it: Mossad primary, CIA and British services witting by
liaison, at the author's hypothesis tier.** Three things travel with it and must not be dropped:
it is argued from documented liaison structure and the Maxwell lineage, **not** from the corpus;
the corpus limit is stated in the same breath (the word appears there only in Epstein's joking
denial to Barak and in a question he asked Barak); and **rung 5 is still refused for everyone.**
*Do not "restore balance" by re-inserting a no-service-named hedge. That is the error that was
just fixed.*

**Also done 11 Sept 2026, at his direction:** Section I cut from four subsections to two — the
symmetry-rule and "what in the files means" subsections removed as excessive, with a compact
definition of both folded into the Section I intro because **the symmetry rule is still invoked
eight times downstream.** The address to service members cut 2,526 → 1,190 words. **Every
safety-critical passage was kept verbatim** and must stay: not a call to disobey lawful orders;
the lawful channels (10 U.S.C. §1034, PPD-19, ICD-120); do not send classified material; and the
**Article 94 mutiny warning** closing the door on coordinated refusal. What went was apparatus —
the Byzantine Generals detour, Schelling/Aumann, and the Watson case study compressed to its
finding and tier note. Scale line now 269 / 1,053 / 121.

**Pipeline trap learned:** deleting a subsection block can carry away a `</div>` that closes the
section's `sect-body` wrapper, which opened *outside* the deleted range. Tag-balance caught it.
**Always diff div balance against a pre-edit backup, not just the absolute count.**

**THE OTHER MAXWELL CHILDREN — researched 11 Sept 2026, unpublished.**
`research/MAXWELL-SIBLINGS.md`. The page carries Christine 0, Isabel 0, Kevin 0, Magellan 0,
Chiliad 0 against PROMIS 39 — in a Section V titled *"Father, Daughter, and the Surviving Node."*
**The reason they belong is the corpus, not the intelligence lineage:** Christine and Isabel
transacted with Epstein directly 2003–2012 (Chiliad equity, a Salty Dog Ventures round pitched to
him, Eli's Trust papers sent to his attention, introductions). Documented and EFTA-cited.

**The PROMIS lineage claim is dead and must not be revived without new documents.** H.R. Rep.
102-857 (1992) and the Bua Report (1993) name Robert Maxwell **zero times** — verified with
control terms, which is what makes a zero meaningful. The only official treatment is DOJ's Sept
1994 review: *"there is nothing of which we are aware that links Mr. Maxwell to PROMIS"*, resting
on Ben-Menashe alone, who admitted he *"simply let the Hamiltons and others assume"* he meant
INSLAW's PROMIS. **Symmetry caution that travels with it:** that review is the accused agency
reviewing itself, so the verb is **never corroborated**, not *disproved*. **And read the denial
narrowly:** DOJ says the FBI's 20 Maxwell pages do not concern PROMIS, not that no FBI Maxwell
file exists. **Chiliad's engine has a documented different parent** — UMass Amherst CIIR's INQUERY
via Sovereign Hill Software, April 1996.

**Killed, do not re-publish:** Christine founding *Information on Demand* (Sue Rugge, Berkeley,
1979); *"a sitting CIA CIO co-founded Chiliad"* (Alan Wade was CIA CIO 2001–05; role contested,
needs a primary); *"bugged software to Fortune 500"* (no source, any tier); Gates and Allen each
putting $20M into Commtouch (it was combined and corporate); the $18M Excite figure (that is the
June announcement, not the August close of 850,000 shares).
**Blocked on:** an EFTA copy of the May–June 2008 Chiliad share thread (hex32-only, so a lead);
reconciling two USAspending totals (~$20.1M/50 vs ~$33.1M/60 awards); tying "Chiliad Publishing
Incorporated" to Christine by filing. **web.archive.org is unreachable from this environment.**

### Still open from 7 September 2026

**FOUR ERRORS FOUND ON THE LIVE PAGE, 7 Sept 2026. Verified, held for the author, not fixed —
he scoped that session to research. Full detail in `research/EPSTEIN-9-11-INTEL-TOPOLOGY.md` §10.**

1. **The 1994 Mirror Group settlement is not a concession.** The apology was for the Oct 1991
   articles attacking Hersh and Faber ("entirely improper"), not for the allegation. Dropping a
   libel action and paying the defendant is not an admission it was true. "Maxwell's own company
   conceded it after he was gone" is the symmetry rule failing our way.
2. **"The CIA Director who met with Epstein in 2014" is our own naming error**, in three places.
   Burns was Deputy Secretary of State until 4 Nov 2014; CIA from 2021.
3. **The FBI Urban Moving serial we cite (24 Sept 2001) is marked (Pending)**, eleven days in.
   The case closed 10 July 2003. The closing memorandum is *better for us*: it records a
   documented CI concern and kills the foreknowledge specimen on physical evidence.
4. **The DEA art-students memo is dated "June 2001" on the page**; the leaked copy may be
   undated. Not verified either way. Get the copy first.

**Also researched, unpublished (same file):** the Nov 2016 Riyadh trip named in the pilot's own
traffic; the Nov 2017 Boies exchange and Barak's "Call me. in Paris."; the Carbyne/Trae Stephens
introduction; the Lutnick contact record including his written acceptance of a Little St. James
lunch for 23 Dec 2012; Epstein to Bannon 6 Dec 2018, "do you know bill barr. CIA ."

**The Epstein↔9/11 question itself: three tests, all NOT REACHED.** The corpus 9/11 null is
clean and is the publishable finding.

---

### Carried from 1 September 2026

- **Which Daniel** — the corpus holds both **Daniel Siad** (13 two-way messages, asked to
  "help facilitate" contact) and **Daniel Sabba** (`@db.com`). Author to disambiguate.
- **Does the Deutsche Bank naming rule extend to Sabba?** Author's call. Nothing published.
- **`research/PRINCIPALS-EMAIL-SWEEP.md`** — the two-populations finding and the MLAT layer
  are researched and unpublished, awaiting direction.
- **The 161 mass-shooting markers name perpetrators.** Not an error; a live editorial
  question against contagion research. Author's call, not the assistant's.
- **79 map markers carry superlatives** ("world's largest", "the only") — spot-checked, not
  systematically verified.
- **Six report sections are stubs** (XXII at 3 KB, XV, XXI, XI, XIV, XIX) beside Section II
  at 267 KB. Structural, and the author's decision to make.
- **`irl.ing`** — the author called it "the most favorite website"; never explained, not in
  the report.

---

## 8. THE POINT

The document's authority does not come from what it alleges. **It comes from what it
refuses to allege.** Every specimen killed, every null published at equal prominence, every
correction printed with its date, every rung-5 claim left unclaimed — that is the asset.
Protect it. The moment this becomes a document that only accumulates, it is worth nothing,
and every operator who reads it is right to discard it.
