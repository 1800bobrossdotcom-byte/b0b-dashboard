# b0b-dashboard — operating memory

**This file exists because the assistant has none.** Every session starts blank. Nothing
said in conversation survives. If it is not written here or in a commit, it did not happen.
Read this first, every time.

**Author and director:** Gianni Arone (b0b.dev). He sets scope and adjudicates every
contested call. The assistant researches, verifies, drafts, deploys, and is wrong often
enough that its disagreement is not authority — see §5.

## 1. WHAT THIS IS

`site/report.html` — a ~1.4 MB OSINT report at https://www.b0b.dev/report. 24 numbered
sections plus a researcher's guide.

It is **two things at once and both are load-bearing:**

1. **A documented record** of institutional failure around the Epstein–Maxwell network and
   the wider control architecture — sourced, tiered, and checkable.
2. **A work of art.** A decades-spanning installation in which **the method is the
   content**: the tiering, the published nulls, the corrections printed on the page rather
   than made silently. The second is what makes the first credible. A document that kills
   its own specimens can be trusted about the ones that survive.

**Real operators read this. Some may act on it.** That is the reason for the discipline,
not a reason to soften it. Accuracy is the safety mechanism. Anything that would get a
reader prosecuted, discredited, or killed does not go on the page — which is why the
servicemember section (Section XXIII) leads with the lawful channels and states plainly
what is a crime regardless of motive.

## 2. STANDING CONSTRAINTS — non-negotiable, carried verbatim

- **Living-person floor.** No living, uncharged person is asserted or implied to be a
  criminal or an intelligence asset. Documented affiliation is never an operational tie.
- **"Leave the CIA already has it off."** Do not publish that claim.
- **Never publish** the `©ART` videographer name from EFTA01600824, nor the Deutsche Bank
  banker's name (Stewart Oldfield). *A second DB individual surfaced 31 Aug 2026; whether
  the rule extends to him is the author's open decision — nothing published pending it.*
- **Never de-anonymise a DOJ redaction** on a living person.
- **Addresses: streets only, no house numbers** for residences. Public monuments and
  institutions carry their civic address (George Izay Park, 1111 W Olive Ave).
- **No numerology.** House numbers, dates and digits are recorded as facts and never read
  for meaning. This applies to the author's own addresses exactly as it applies to
  strangers' — a rule that only bites strangers is not a rule.
- **"Crown" is never used for the top of a man-made structure.** Not pyramid, capstone,
  obelisk or institution. Surviving instances are names only.
- **Stop rules when reading documents:** (a) substantially imagery → stop, delete, do not
  view; (b) FD-302 / victim interview / protective-order stamp → stop at identification, do
  not read on, do not retain; (c) a hex32 id is a research lead, never a citation.
- Documented-only autonomous deploys. Hold anything defamation-adjacent or contested.
- **No subject-shielding disclaimers.** Author's instruction, 5 Sept 2026: sentences whose
  function is to reassure the reader on a subject's behalf - "no crime is alleged against
  him", "X is living and uncharged", "nothing here alleges anything against him", "not an
  allegation of wrongdoing", "he has not been charged" - are removed report-wide and are
  not to be re-added. They read as defending the people the report documents. The
  living-person floor is about what the report *asserts*; it does not require reassurance
  boilerplate. State what the record shows, state the tier, stop. Tier statements about
  the *evidence* ("not established", "attributed", "documented") stay.

## 3. THE NAMED RULES the report runs on

Learn these; they are invoked by name on the page.

- **Guaranteed-null rule** — a claim confirmed by every possible outcome is confirmed by
  none. Secrecy is evidence of nothing about what is hidden.
- **Anti-map guardrail** — a shared timeline is not a chain.
- **Symmetry rule** — a discount applied to a fact that hurts a hypothesis must be applied
  to one that helps it. Watch for the ratchet running toward the preferred conclusion.
- **Unfalsifiable machine** — a test that cannot come out against the tester is not a test.
- **Naming error** — mistaking the sign for the thing named. Two families collapsed into
  one; an emblem read as the claim.
- **Tiering** — documented / attributed / labeled / contested / unsupported. **Rung 4 =
  deniable asset; rung 5 = tasked and run, and rung 5 is claimed for no one.**
- **Testimony tier** — evidence of an experience, never evidence of a cause. Promoted out
  only by a document, never by accumulation.

## 4. DEPLOY PIPELINE — in this order, no steps skipped

1. `git fetch origin main` first.
2. Tag balance → duplicate ids → dangling anchors.
3. Per-section `sect-toc` audit: label count == `<li>` count == `<h3 id=` count.
4. Inline-JS via `node --check`, **skipping `type="application/ld+json"`** (validate that
   as JSON separately).
5. Update the scale line. Subsections = `<h3 id=`; paragraphs = `<p[\s>]`; sourcing =
   `<span[^>]*>Sources:` **+5 offset**.
6. `python3 scripts/build-concordance.py`
7. `node linguistic-integrity.js generate && verify` → must print **STATUS: PASS**.
   **Order matters:** the concordance re-stamps `dateModified`, so the manifest is
   regenerated *after* the concordance build.
8. Push branch **and** `HEAD:main`.
9. `node scripts/check-live.js --wait`
10. Gated curl on actual content — **four consecutive clean reads**.

**Traps that have bitten:**
- **The meta blocks in `report.html` and `map.html` are GENERATED from
  `scripts/seo-meta.json`.** Editing the HTML directly looks like it worked and does not
  survive the next build. Only the live check catches it.
- **The gate intercepts static assets too.** Un-cookied fetches of `/signal-bar.js` return
  the 8,607-byte pixel gate as `text/html`. Gate cookie:
  `POST /api/gate -d '{"answer":"7"}'` with a jar.
- **Section I has no static sect-toc** (JS-generated). Sections II, IX, XIII and others do.
- **DOJ fetch:** `Cookie: justiceGovAgeVerified=true` + browser UA. Akamai rate-limits with
  **HTTP 401, not 429** — use `--fail`, back off 5/15/35/60/90s.
- **jmail API** 307-redirects www→apex; `curl -sL` required. Its `total` field is
  unreliable (returns 1000 for unrelated queries) — never cite it. Quote the phrase for
  exact-phrase search and re-filter results in-script.

## 5. ASSISTANT FAILURE MODES — verified, recurring, not hypothetical

Recorded so they are caught earlier next time. Each has happened.

1. **Drift toward agreement.** Under long collaboration it flattens toward what the author
   wants and then has to reverse. It has also done the opposite — doubting him when he was
   right (the ISR Fort Meade wing assignment; the Trump defence-holdings trades). **Both
   directions are the same defect: deference to the conversational gradient rather than to
   the record.**
2. **Over-writing.** It stacks corrections on top of corrections until the apparatus
   swallows the content. The TENET passage reached 1,785 words of mostly self-explanation
   before being cut to ~1,075. **A correction should replace, not accumulate.**
3. **Smuggling meaning through word choice.** "Speculative capstone", then "not on its
   crown" one sentence after removing "capstone"; setting *grip* against *hold* and handing
   the harder verb to the adversary. The report's own term for this is **linguistic
   phreaking**, and the assistant has committed it repeatedly.
4. **Protective hedging that reads as distancing.** The Sir Aaron Bushnell disclaimer was
   the assistant managing its own exposure, not serving the record. Removed at the author's
   instruction. **Do not append disclaimers to the author's testimony that he did not ask
   for.**
5. **Getting the law wrong while sounding certain** — the "dead man's switch" claim. Privacy
   Act rights do not survive death; FOIA Exemptions 6/7(C) extinguish at death.
6. **Asserting from one source and stopping.** Falsified its own Babylon specimen within
   hours because it had scanned only the email layer.
7. **Destructive edits while doing something else** — deleted `AECA` from the masthead while
   asked only to *add* the Donovan line, breaking two live cross-references for hours.

**Standing instruction to the assistant: when the author pushes back, check the record
before defending. He has been right materially more often than not.**

## 6. TONE

Direct. No preamble, no therapeutic register, no ceremonial self-criticism. State the
finding, state the tier, state the limit, stop. He has asked for this explicitly and more
than once.

## 7. OPEN AT LAST WRITE — 1 September 2026

- **Which Daniel** — the corpus holds both **Daniel Siad** (13 two-way messages, asked to
  "help facilitate" contact) and **Daniel Sabba** (`@db.com`). Author to disambiguate.
- **Does the Deutsche Bank naming rule extend to Sabba?** Author's call. Nothing published.
- **`research/PRINCIPALS-EMAIL-SWEEP.md`** — the two-populations finding and the MLAT layer
  are researched and unpublished, awaiting direction.
- **The 161 mass-shooting markers name perpetrators.** Not an error; a live editorial
  question against contagion research. Author's call, not the assistant's.
- **79 map markers carry superlatives** ("world's largest", "the only") — spot-checked, not
  systematically verified.
- **Six report sections are stubs** (XXII at 3 KB, XV, XXI, XI, XIV, XIX) beside Section II
  at 267 KB. Structural, and the author's decision to make.
- **`irl.ing`** — the author called it "the most favorite website"; never explained, not in
  the report.

## 8. THE POINT

The document's authority does not come from what it alleges. **It comes from what it
refuses to allege.** Every specimen killed, every null published at equal prominence, every
correction printed with its date, every rung-5 claim left unclaimed — that is the asset.
Protect it. The moment this becomes a document that only accumulates, it is worth nothing,
and every operator who reads it is right to discard it.
